# DiscordChatWithGPT
This is a WIP Discord Bot that uses that uses OpenAI's GPT-3 API to send prompts to GPT-3 and server the response back to the user in the form of a discord message. The code will not work unless you use your own OpenAI key and your own Discord Bot Token. I used python for this.
